    <h2>The Learned Woman</h2>

    <h6>HEN. It is about the marriage which my mother has set her heart upon
        that I wish, Sir, to speak privately to you; and I thought that,
        seeing how our home is disturbed by it, I should be able to make you
        listen to reason. You are aware that with me you will receive a
        considerable dowry; but money, which we see so many people esteem, has
        no charms worthy of a philosopher; and contempt for wealth and earthly
        grandeur should not show itself in your words only.
        
        TRI. Therefore it is not that which charms me in you; but your
        dazzling beauty, your sweet and piercing eyes, your grace, your noble
        air--these are the wealth, the riches, which have won for you my vows
        and love; it is of those treasures only that I am enamoured.
        
        HEN. I thank you for your generous love; I ought to feel grateful and
        to respond to it; I regret that I cannot; I esteem you as much as one
        can esteem another; but in me I find an obstacle to loving you. You
        know that a heart cannot be given to two people, and I feel that
        Clitandre has taken entire possession of mine. I know that he has much
        less merit than you, that I have not fit discrimination for the choice
        of a husband, and that with your many talents you ought to please me.
        I see that I am wrong, but I cannot help it; and all the power that
        reason has over me is to make me angry with myself for such blindness.
        
        TRI. The gift of your hand, to which I am allowed to aspire, will give
        me the heart possessed by Clitandre; for by a thousand tender cares I
        have reason to hope that I shall succeed in making myself loved.
        
        HEN. No; my heart is bound to its first love, and cannot be touched by
        your cares and attention. I explain myself plainly with you, and my
        confession ought in no way to hurt your feelings. The love which
        springs up in the heart is not, as you know, the effect of merit, but
        is partly decided by caprice; and oftentimes, when some one pleases
        us, we can barely find the reason. If choice and wisdom guided love,
        all the tenderness of my heart would be for you; but love is not thus
        guided. Leave me, I pray, to my blindness; and do not profit by the
        violence which, for your sake, is imposed on my obedience. A man of
        honour will owe nothing to the power which parents have over us; he
        feels a repugnance to exact a self-sacrifice from her he loves, and
        will not obtain a heart by force. Do not encourage my mother to
        exercise, for your sake, the absolute power she has over me. Give up
        your love for me, and carry to another the homage of a heart so
        precious as yours.
        
        TRI. For this heart to satisfy you, you must impose upon it laws it
        can obey. Could it cease to love you, Madam, unless you ceased to be
        loveable, and could cease to display those celestial charms....
        
        HEN. Ah! Sir, leave aside all this trash; you are encumbered with so
        many Irises, Phyllises, Amaranthas, which everywhere in your verses
        you paint as charming, and to whom you swear such love, that....</h6>
